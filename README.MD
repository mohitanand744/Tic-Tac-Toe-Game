* Player 2 (or the computer, if you've implemented AI) then takes their turn by clicking on another empty square.
* Players continue taking turns until a win condition is met or the game ends in a draw.


* Implementation Details

* HTML:

The game board is represented using a 3x3 grid of <div> elements.
Each square on the grid is clickable and responds to player input.

* CSS:

Basic styling is applied to the game board to make it visually appealing.
CSS is used to handle hover effects and visual feedback when a square is clicked.

* JavaScript:

The game logic is implemented using JavaScript.
Event listeners are used to detect when a square is clicked.
Functions are implemented to check for win conditions and determine the outcome of the game.
Optionally, you can implement an AI opponent using algorithms like minimax to make the game more challenging.
Future Enhancements
Implementing a scoreboard to keep track of wins for each player.
